"""
Chef has started developing interest in playing chess, and was learning how the Queen moves.

Chef has an empty NÃ—N chessboard. He places a Queen at (X,Y) and wonders - What are the number of cells that are under attack by the Queen?

Notes:

- The top-left cell is (1,1), the top-right cell is (1,N), the bottom-left cell is (N,1) and the bottom-right cell is (N,N).
- The Queen can be moved any number of unoccupied cells in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
- The cell on which the Queen is present, is not said to be under attack by the Queen.

Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains three integers N, X and Y, as described in the problem statement.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the total number of cells that are under attack by the Queen.
